# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Anix

## Introduction
Welcome to Anix, a Discord bot project I developed in 2022 for a server of friends, completed in under two weeks. By the end of its development, the bot had been deployed on four servers and featured various functions, including:

- A verification system
- A "nuker" feature that could dismantle servers (this function was hardcoded to operate only on non-allowed servers)

As my circle of friends has changed and my use of Discord has ceased, I no longer maintain the bot. All keys and data associated with this project are long gone, and the Discord invite links are no longer valid.

## Project Status
This repository is now archived. While the code is available for educational purposes, please note the following:

- **Outdated Code**: The Discord.py code used in this bot is very outdated and may not function as intended. I have not tested it in its current state.
- **Lack of Unit Tests**: The project lacks unit tests and proper documentation, as it was initially a hobby project and not intended for public release.

I encourage anyone interested in learning how to create a Discord bot or exploring the use of cogs to review the code, but please keep these limitations in mind.

## Disclaimer
This project is not representative of my best work and is shared purely for educational purposes. Use it at your own risk, as this project may not function properly with the current versions of the Discord API or Discord.py, given that it relies on a very outdated version.

This project is licensed under the WTFPL license, meaning you have NO WARRANTY, and I have NO LIABILITY for your actions or applications. You are free to use the code in different projects or for commercial purposes without restrictions.

Thank you for your interest!
